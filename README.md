# Code Quiz

## Project Description
As you proceed in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this project invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write.
Main features in this application:
* Click Start button to start the code quiz.
* When click the start button, a timer starts and you will be presented with a question
* You will expect the next question when you answer current question.
* If you answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock
* When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over
* You can save your initials and score at the end.
